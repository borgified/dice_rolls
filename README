answers the age old question when you have both:

a bobbit knife - Damage is 5d5 (average 15).

a fountain pen - Damage is 1d30 (average 15) [actually 15.5].

run_experiment($sample_size,$x,$y);

so to test bobbit knife: run_experiment(100000,5,5)
see results: https://github.com/borgified/dice_rolls/blob/master/output_knife

so to test fountain pen: run_experiment(100000,1,30)
see results: https://github.com/borgified/dice_rolls/blob/master/output_pen

for the bobbit knife, out of 100000 tries, the damage that resulted most often is 15. it comes up around 12k times or about 12% of the time. other damages like 13,14 and 16,17 come up around 10-11% of the time. so adding all these together you have a pretty healthy 50%+ chance of hitting btwn 13-17.

for the fountain pen, since it is 1d30, it's pretty even across the board. in other words, you are just as likely to hit for 1 as you are to hit for 30, so out of 100k tries, you'd hit for 1 around ~3300 times. likewise, you hit for 2 around ~3300 times also and so on. so let's see what our chances are of hitting btwn 13-17 damage. 3300*5/100k = 16.5%

so based on these results, typically, bobbit knife would beat fountain pen hands down unless you are in a situation where you are very desperate (ie. your equipment is vastly inferior to your enemies) so you just need to take a chance with the pen (which has higher top end damage (30 vs 25)) and just hope that you roll the higher than 25.

what are the chances of rolling higher than 25 for fountain pen? 3300*5/100k = 16.5%
